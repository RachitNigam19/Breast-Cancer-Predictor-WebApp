# 🎗️ Breast-Cancer-Predictor-WebApp
This repository contains a machine learning-powered web application for predicting breast cancer based on medical data. Built with Flask for a responsive web interface and scikit-learn for predictive modeling, this project demonstrates expertise in data science, web development, and deployment for impactful health applications.
📖 Overview
The Breast Cancer Predictor WebApp uses a trained machine learning model to classify breast cancer cases (e.g., benign or malignant) based on features like cell measurements. The Flask-based web interface allows users to input data and receive predictions, while the Jupyter Notebook (breast cancer ml model.ipynb) provides a detailed walkthrough of model development. The project is deployment-ready with a procfile for platforms like Heroku.
🎯 Features

Predicts breast cancer outcomes using a trained ML model.
Responsive web interface built with Flask, HTML, and CSS.
Supports user input for medical features (e.g., cell size, shape).
Includes a Jupyter Notebook for model training and evaluation.
Deployment-ready setup with a procfile for Heroku.
Modular codebase for easy maintenance and scalability.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language.
Flask: Lightweight framework for building the web application.
Scikit-learn: For training and serving the breast cancer prediction model.
Pandas/NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive model development and analysis.
HTML/CSS: For front-end UI (in templates and static folders).
Gunicorn: WSGI server for deployment (via procfile).
Git: Version control with .gitignore for clean repository management.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Git
Heroku CLI (optional, for deployment)

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/RachitNigam19/Breast-Cancer-Predictor-WebApp.git
cd Breast-Cancer-Predictor-WebApp


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Ensure the serialized model (breast_cancer_model.pkl) is in the root directory.

Usage

Run the Flask application locally:python app.py


Access the app at http://localhost:5000.


Input medical data (e.g., cell measurements) via the web UI to get predictions.
Explore the Jupyter Notebook (breast cancer ml model.ipynb) for model training and evaluation:jupyter notebook breast cancer ml model.ipynb



Deployment (Optional)

Deploy to Heroku:heroku create
git push heroku main
heroku open


Ensure the procfile is configured (e.g., web: gunicorn app:app).

🔍 How It Works

Dataset: The Jupyter Notebook likely uses a dataset (e.g., UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin) with features like cell size, shape, and texture.
Model: The breast_cancer_model.pkl file stores a trained scikit-learn model (e.g., logistic regression or SVM) for classifying cancer cases.
Preprocessing: Scripts like breast_cancer_prediction.py or predictive_model.py handle data preprocessing and prediction logic.
Web UI: The app.py script uses Flask to serve a web interface, with HTML templates in templates and styling in static.
Deployment: The procfile enables deployment on Heroku using Gunicorn.
